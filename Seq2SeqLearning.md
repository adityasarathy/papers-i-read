[Recurrent Neural Networks as Sequence Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)
========================================================================
####TL;DR: Recurrent Neural Networks have seen a lot of attention as powerful models that are able to decode sequences from signals. The paper reviews some recent successes on machine translation, image understanding, and beyond. The key component of such methods are the use of a recurrent neural network architecture that is trained end-to-end to optimize the probability of the output sequence given those signals.
