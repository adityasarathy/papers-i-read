TL;DR : Deep learning techniques can approximate the value function of an RL algorithm much more accurately than standard method
because they find the adequate features for doing so. This insight led to a first breakthrough when a CNN was combined with a slightly modified version of the standard Q-Learning algorithm to get impressive results in a large set of challenging video game problem.
